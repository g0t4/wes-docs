# wes-index

This started as notes. It still mostly is until I have more copious spare time to update it.

I want to eventually make it into a (idiomatic wes) succinct resource like `tldr`.

Enjoy

## Readiness labeling

| label       |     |                                                    |
| ----------- | --- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `outdated`  | 💾  | was `ready`, needs to be updated                   |
| `ready`     | 🌕  | as of the date it was written (`git blame`)        |
| `partially` | 🌓  | part is, and part isn't... I may mark respectively |
| `nascent`   | 🌒  | ~ 🐓 scratch (random notes )                       |
| `no label`  | 🌑  | not ready, may never be `ready`                    |
