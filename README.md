# wes-doc - demystifying technology

This started as a way for me to keep notes, which I enjoy. But it's grown into an interest to build it up into something more after tools like `tldr` are inspiring me to create simple, often missing, pragmatic docs for many a tool, framewor, library, etc... they're all missing it, even my notes... but I aim to make something better and if you find value, great! If future Wes finds value, great too!

Enjoy

## Readiness labeling

- `No label` = unknown = not ready
- `ready` = ready as of latest changes (`git blame` extensions to your IDE would help identify if someting was ready but is no more)
- `partially`
- `insane` - not ready! - things I'm playing with (maybe learning, maybe early chicken scratch with no organization and I want to not fret over polishing what I share so much as just sharing and most important not wasting my time cleaning up notes I may never again touch)
- `outdated` - a way to flag what was once ready but no longer is so I can revisit when my copious spare time avails! 

## Want to make fun of me! Please do!

Ok please be polite at least, I am hard headed but even my hard head can crack :) that said **polite** is subjective... and to me it includes truth above ego. Who cares what my ego thinks, it can absorb the truth and be self-confident in that as easily as whatever it knows now (falsehoods and truths combined). 

I will have much that is WIP, perhaps you want to contribute too! Send in some PRs and let's see if that meshes with what I want to accomplish. Credit will be given wherever due (I'm thinking man page style where names are listed at bottom of man page)... So, I would appreciate help with:
- Concision
- Organization
- Linking (I should rename this to wes-index)
- Missing tool recommendations and missing major feature sets
- Telling me some tool like `tldr` can compliment or just fulfill my desires here.

I would use `tldr` but what fun is it to be a geek and not make it myself! Nah I see this as the word of Wes not necessarily `tldr`'s focus and I often feel they don't have a fundamental desire to cover the depth I want. They will always rock with breadth.
