# GitHub

## Learning

- [Guides](https://guides.github.com) - high quality, visual tours of features. Like an article + annotated screencaps meant to be read from start to finish.
- [Docs](https://docs.github.com/) - compliment to guides in that these are formal, specification like and aren't meant to be read from start to finish but more of a nuanced reference.
  - [Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/discussions) - ~forum like threaded conversations
  - [Actions] - workflows (from low level on up) baked right into GitHub - this is and will continue to be increasingly popular given the popularity of GitHub. It actually makes a ton of sense to have a no install, configuration first (yaml workflows) (with minimal in many cases, especially basic) workflow based system baked right along with code and all your project, issue, bug, discussion, package (release) management etc management... it's just adding CI/CD to the list. I have yet to test it at scale but I imagine it just works.
- [ ] TODO list prominent features and entrypoints to docs along with my thoughts of the features
