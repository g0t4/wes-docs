## Vagrant basics

Here are some terms and my general thoughts about `vagrant` (a tool I ðŸ’–)

- `provider` - a (intentional, well designed) leaky abstraction of hypervisors (`VirtualBox`, `Hyper-V`, `VMWare`, `docker`, etc)
  - abstraction in the sense that `vagrant` encapsulates many commonalities:
    - standardizing on config via a `Vagrantfile`!
    - configuring `memory` and `cpu` resources consistently 
    - or, networking with forwarded_port, private_network and/or public_network
  - leaky in the sense that the hypervisor is:
    - explicitly: 
      - specified at least on initial call to vagrant up (`vagrant up --provider=virtualbox`)
      - a box is limited by the hypervisors it was built to support
      - in vm config blocks in Vagrantfile
    - nuanced config (lower level) like VirtualBox's `--modifyvm` flag
  - additional providers can be installed via [provider plugins](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/plugins/providers)
- `provisioner` - configuration management to predictably and automatically tailor a VM to your needs beyond what is provided in the `box` which can be thought of as a starting point.

      - [ansible_local](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning/ansible_local) executed on `self-configuring` guest - think ansible's local connection type
- `performance`: 
  - disable checking for box updates (as needed)
    - Add to Vagrantfile: `config.vm.box_check_update = false`
    - Manually invoke `vagrant box outdated` as desired
    - Normally, every time `vagrant up` the box is checked and the user is warned if there's a newer **box**
