# Debian Repository Format (spec)

- https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format#Debian_Repository_Format
  - Goal is to become a sub-policy, for now this spec doc states it is a WIP for how repositories should be structured and how clients should interact with a repo.
- IMO this is a very inconsistent set of docs
  - Verbiage is not carefully used to refer to things, for example `distribution` is often used to describe several other terms like `release` or `archive` or `suite` etc

## TODO - later distill and merge with other notes
